# First Repository Made Using Git at the PowerShell
* Commands I've learned
    * git init
    * git add .
    * git push got messy because I made a new repository name on GitHub.com and created a license file there instead of adding an existing repository.
        * I had to git remote add hello-powershell <link>
        * git pull hello-powershell
        * git push --set-upstream hello-powershell master

* This is too complicated for a first try.
